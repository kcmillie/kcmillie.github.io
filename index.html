        <!--2 paragraphs about me -->
        <p>
        I am graduated college in 2013 with a Bachelor's degree in engineering.  I went to school in Michigan.  My first job was in Arizona
        I moved back to the midwest after living in Tucson for 4 years.  I didn't like Arizona because it was too hot all year round.  Everything
        was always dusty and there was not as much to do as there is in Kansas City unless you get in a car and drive around.
        </p>

        <p>
        I wish I could do hobbies all day and not have to work.  I enjoy knitting and sewing.  I run because it keeps me in shaped and allows me
        to eat what I enjoy and not have to go on a diet.  I enjoy all the people I have met through running.  I used to play roller derby.  I like to cook and bake.  I enjoy my alone time.
